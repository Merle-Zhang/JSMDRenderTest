# JSMDRenderTest

This is a prototype for dynamically rendering markdown file in a static site.

To try it out, go to https://merle-zhang.github.io/JSMDRenderTest/render.html, and then paste in the url to raw markdown file, e.g. the testing markdown 
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Merle-Zhang/JSMDRenderTest/main/testmd.md
```
or any other markdown you want.

This prototype mainly uses https://github.com/markedjs/marked to render the markdown.
